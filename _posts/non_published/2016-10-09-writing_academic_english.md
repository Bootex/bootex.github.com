### Info Ordering

#### Given-News



##### Organising flow

Your text must also have a sense of unity ('coherence'), that you are discussing something, not simply introducing/ briefly touching on a list of ideas.







##### Creating focus

**'Topic'** and **'comment'** are very closely connected to the concepts of 'given' and 'new' information. 



The **topic** is the matter or idea currently being discussed in the text.(*Given*)



The **comment** is what is being said about the matter or idea currently being disccused.(*New*)



##### Topical progression

There are four kinds of patterns to show topic.



###### Constant Topic

When we explain the same topic in each sentence.

| Topic | Comment | Example     |
| :---- | :------ | ----------- |
| A     | B       | A: a item   |
| A     | C       | A: It       |
| A     | D       | A: The item |



###### Progressive Topic

When we expand comments in each sentence.

| Topic | Comment | Example                                  |
| :---- | :------ | ---------------------------------------- |
| A     | B       | B: the same plate                        |
| B     | C       | B: the holographic plate, C: experimental model |
| C     | D       | C: the model                             |



###### Hypertopic

When we provide examples about the topic.

| Topic | Comment | Example                     |
| :---- | :------ | --------------------------- |
| A     | B       | A: A lot of different items |
| A1    | C       | A1: First one               |
| A2    | D       | A2: Second one              |
| A3    | E       | A3: The last one            |



###### Split topic

When we explain some kind of subtopics related to the comment.

| Topic | Comment | Example              |
| :---- | :------ | -------------------- |
| A     | B       | B: Two kind of items |
| B1    | C       | B1: One item         |
| B2    | D       | B2: The other thing  |



#### Common problems

1. If you fail to provide a consistent topic, readers will have difficulty in seeing what your text is about.
2.  Readers may not follow the logic between your sentences if you don't use the expected patterns of topical progression.
3.  Careless use of synonyms to refer to the same concept can lead to confusion.
4.  Problems with topical choice and topical progression may cost you money and the chance to get published.



### Reparing problems

1. Use direct repetition, synonyms, or superordinate terms
2. Use a pronoun (it, they / this, these)
3. Use a 'topicalising phrase'
4. Use an 'active-passive shift'
5. Use an 'equative shift'
6. Use an 'animate-inanimate shift'
7. Use an 'personal-impersonal shift'
