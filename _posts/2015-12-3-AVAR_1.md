##Day 1
###Android collusion - Intel
####pp collusion
####Android security model
- Permission-based
- AndroidManifest.xml declarations
- Android 6.0 allows dynamic permissions

####Open channels
- Intetnts
- Content Providers( store data in a table like DB)
- External storage(SD Card)
- Shared perferences

####Hidden(covert) Channels
- Audio settings, settings broadcast
- wake lock, file lock
- Enumeration of porcess
- ETC

####collusions
- One applications have some restriction to access system, however opening other applications have privilege to access system can do harmful things.

####Demonstraion
- server send to android to run a app. this app can.

####Conclusions
- Android OS has a design problem.
- App collusions are possible.
- No more than ~7% of apps may collude.
- Tools to detect collusions are required.

###DoS trojans in embedded devices
####History
- ELF IoT Malware.
####Common characteristic
- ELF header
- segments
- sections
    - Names (.bss,.init,.got, .plt, .rel, .rodata, .strtab, .symtab, .text)
    - special types
    - .rodata contain strings.
- settings
    - /etc/init.d/
        - startup
    - /etc/crond/
        - make schedule.
- tools
    - Bot builder
    - C&C panels( ELF:MrBlack )
    - gafgyt
    - tsunami
        - kaiten.c
    - Aidra
    - powbot - bypassing cloudflare?
    - MrBlack
    - Xorddos
- LKM based on an open-source rootkit called suterusu

###New APT
####APT briefing
- Advancde Persistent Threat

#### New APT Camaign
- RTLO
- Malware
- BackDoor
    - BIFORSE
    - KIVARS
- C&C Monitoring

###Detecting

##Day2
###Destructive ransomeware
#### - Static Detection Difficult
- VB, NSIs, SFX - Packer

#### - Process Injection - Implications for dynamic blockinG
- Into spawned non-OS
- Into spwaned running OS

####  Typical Encryption Lifecycle
- target lock using session key
- C&C have Master Private Key

#### Assumptions
- Ransomeware bypass first-line defences
- OS privilege-control features

#### - Modus operandi
- local target
- take hostage
- demand ransom

#### - Generic Ransomware trackingw
#### - Triggers
- Dir Enumeration
- Process-level Context
    - Few inect code into process
- Thread-level Context
    - CTB Locker - Multiple threads split work
    - Insufficeint
- Code-BLock level Contet
- Android ransomware
    - simple locker
- Window Ransomware Encryptors
    - cryptolokcer, crptowall, CTB locker, telsa crypt, onion locker

###Data URSNIF malware
####URSNIF malware and its history
- as a data-stealing malware
- as the file infector

####Recent enhancements on URSNIF
- Data Steakubg Routines
- To gather system informations
    - cmd /C "systeminfo.exe > %s"
    - cmd /C "tasklist.exe /SVC >> %s"
- Backdoor Routines
- API Hooking
    - WINNET.DLL

####Summary

###We know what you did this summer, Android
####Backend-as-a-Service
- Using Baas, Anroid can connect cloud services.
	- Push Noitfication
	- Data Storage
	- User Administration
	- Social Network

- OpFake
#### Conclusions
- Android banking trojans stores and exposes its data in BaaS solutions.
- By default no authentications is needed to access BaaS data
- Android Banking Trojans are actively performing financial fraud via SMS.
- In less than a month, thousands of people were victims of financial fraud.

### Win32.Doboc - A splice between a file infector and a botnet
#### conbining tech
### Botnets and file infectors
- Virlock
- Doboc

### Botnet inside Doboc
- Botnets are widely usde to:
	- steal/intercept
- File infectors provide:
	- fast spreading ability

There are two versions of DGA
First is fix number of domain names.
	- Second Level of domain name.
Second is time based.

Communication protocol
Data -> Compressed Data -> CRC Code
MD5 Hash check

Connect to C&C server using Get, Post method.

### Reversing Doboc


### Delivering the malware
### Conclusions
- We expect malware tech to get mixed and improved further than we saw.
- A critical point will be the replacement of the manual reshaping process of malware with automated tools.
- We also expect automation for botnets, anti-analysis and file infectors.

#### Operation buthrap
### Target to Russian
