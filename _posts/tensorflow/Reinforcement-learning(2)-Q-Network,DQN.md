$$
\hat y = X^TW
$$


$$
cost(W) = (Ws - y)^2
$$



$$
y = r + \gamma \max Q(s')
$$






1. Initialize action-value function Q with random weights
2. for episode = 1, M do
3. Initialize sequence s1 = {x1} and preprocessed sequenced $\pi$



DQN



Initialize replay memory $D$ to capacity $N'$







Network



1. Go Deep
2. Replay minibatch
3. â€‹
