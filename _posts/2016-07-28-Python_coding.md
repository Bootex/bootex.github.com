## THINK LIKE PYTHON
**generally It is important to work like python with python.**  
There are specific methods and statements in python. Python programmers emphasize simple and legibility using that. This pattern will be helpful for your work.

### Check your python version

python --version
```

```
import sys

print(sys.version_info)
print(sys.version)

```


### Follow PEP 8 guide
PEP[^PEP] dd

### Differences Byte, str, unicode

### Use heler method instead of complicated expression

### How to slice sequence

### Don't use start, end, stride in one slice

### Use list comprehension instead of map and filter

### Don't use list comprehension more than two

### Use generation with large comprehension

### Use enumerate instead of range

### Use zip to process iterator in parallel

### Don't use else after repetitive statement like for and while

### Use benefits of each block in try/except/else/finally
