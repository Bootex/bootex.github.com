## What is Pattern Recognition?
Pattern recognition is a branch of machine learning that focuses on the **recognition of patterns** and **regularities in data**, although it is in some cases considered to be nearly synonymous with machine learning. - [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pattern_recognition)


## Supervised learning and Unsupervised learning
Basically, There are two kinds of methods recognizing patterns. **Supervised learning** and **Unsupervised learning**.

### Supervised learning
Supervised learning needs training sets to make an objective function,a model. Training data consist of  observation values. each training data has results which are correct or not. After training, a model can be made. And it can predict which is correct or not. Using this process, we can get the accuracy of the model. Basically, it is used in Machine learning.

- Linear regression, Handwriting recognition, Fraud detection, spam filtering.

### Unsupervised learning
Unsupervised learning doesn't need training data. Input data is latent values. Also, no desired output exists. In almost case, unsupervised learning makes groups which have some similar characters.

- clustering, grouping with customers who have similar characters.

## Application using Pattern Recognition
Pattern recognition can utilize many kind of fields. There are some of examples using pattern recognition.

OCR(Optical Character Recognition)
This is text recognition from images. For example, Using this technology, we can read the text in images like pdf, jpg, etc...

Motion detection
Motion detection is very useful to detect thieves in the alert system. There is some kind of detection methods. It can find out the difference between previous and current images. The more advanced detection system can use face recognition, voice pattern etc.        

customer pattern in the market
It is often used as one of marketing methods. When some people buy something, These people have the high probability of purchasing other things. Using this pattern, Some market managers can change positions of items.

Handwriting recognition
MNIST is one of the famous pattern recognition about Handwriting. Using Likelihood in n*n pixel images, the images is recognized like sets of dots.

Fingerprint recognition
This technology is used to identify persons in offices. Human has a unique fingerprint. It means that each person has personal patterns. If we can distinguish and match people.

Voice recognition
Siri in iPhone is one of good example using Voice recognition. Like the fingerprint, It can be used to recognize each person. Also, My phone answered when i say some sentences not other person say something.


### The algorithms in Pattern Recognition

**Classification**
Classification is used to classify data. There three kinds of color dots. green, blue, red. In this case, the line can classify two kinds of colors. However, two blue dots exists. They are outliers in this graph.

**Clustering**
It makes groups have similar characters. In this graph, each dot is pointed in x-axis and y-axis. It is one of unsupervised learning to make groups.

**Regression**
It is the linear regression is one of supervised learning. Using this model, We can predict the value if another item is added. The line which has ordinary least square is made.
